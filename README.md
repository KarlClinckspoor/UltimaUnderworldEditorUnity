# Ultima Underworld 1 Editor Unity (aka Ultimate Editor aka Krokots' UW1 Editor)

This repo exists to more widely divulge the work of krokots, a user in the GOG forums that created a fantastic
editor for the game Ultima Underworld 1.

It was released [here, in 2019](https://www.gog.com/forum/ultima_series/ultima_underworld_editor_release/post1)
and received one update. In 2024, he released
the [source code](https://www.gog.com/forum/ultima_series/ultima_underworld_editor_release/post27).
However, it was stored
in [mediafire, a file hosting service](https://www.mediafire.com/file/scd95y48iymtyh0/UltimateEditor_0.2_source.zip/file),
which can vanish anytime. So I created this repo to make it available for everyone.

He published two videos, [this one is about traps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u94tdpnkd3g)
and [this one is about the conversation engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh0s3iswLYA).

[Unity version 2020.3.32f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.32) was used successfully to build this
project. It is unknown if newer versions will work.

This repo doesn't contain everything available in his zipped file, like the dlls for Newtonsoft.Json. Hopefully
it's enough to open and edit.

The randomizer features (Sectors) aren't implemented.

UW2 loading and editing isn't available.
